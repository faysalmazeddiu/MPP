Answer ::

HashMap was used here to find out the duplicate objects of Employee.besides,
HashMap.containsKey() internally check the equality of hashCode of Object 
superclass but sub class "employee" did not override the hashCode() method. 
since, hashCode() was not override, so default  hashCode() method generates
different hash codes for different objects for same value. it will function perfectly ,
if hashCode() method is overridden in Employee class
