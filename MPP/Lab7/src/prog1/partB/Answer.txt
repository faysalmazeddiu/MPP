Answer ::


The equals method of Object class was not overridden properly
by Employee class.

right way to override equals method: 

	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		
		if (obj == null) {
			return false;
		}
		if(!(obj instanceof Employee)){
			return false;
		}
		Employee e = (Employee) obj;
		return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
	}
